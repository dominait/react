# reactkit
reactkit is just a stripped down version of the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Some of the create-react-app content has been removed to give a simple starting point for beginners to build using react.

## how to use
Once you have downloaded the reactki run npm install this will install the dependancies listed in the package.json file. The only thing that has been added are:
- styled components
- prop types


## npm
In the project directory, you can run:
- npm start runs development copy from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- npm test
- npm run build (production build)
