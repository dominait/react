# reactkit
reactkit is just a stripped down version of the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Some of the create-react-app content has been removed to give a simple starting point for beginners to build using react.

## how to use
Once you have downloaded the reactki run npm install this will install the dependancies listed in the package.json file. The only thing that has been added are:
- styled components
- prop types
- uuid



## npm
In the project directory, you can run your app from the command line using: npm start
- npm start runs development copy of your app from [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- to create a production build use npm run build. Make sure to add the url to the apps hompage in the package.json file before you build. You can download and install serve using npm install serve -D.
